# React Practice Lab

This repository contains a collection of **small, focused React practice exercises** that I worked on to strengthen my fundamentals.

Most of this practice was done during **daily train travel between home and college**, using short but consistent coding sessions to improve logic, confidence, and fluency with React.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

- Build confidence in React by practicing core concepts repeatedly
- Focus on **logic and patterns**, not UI polish
- Learn how to start features from scratch without relying on tutorials
- Document my learning process openly

This is **practice code**, not a production-ready project — and that’s intentional.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

The exercises in this repo cover:

- React state management (`useState`)
- Conditional rendering
- Lists, filtering, and CRUD logic
- Multi-step form logic
- Tabs, accordions, dropdowns
- Theme toggling (light/dark)
- LocalStorage persistence
- Custom hooks (`useLocalStorage`)
- Basic routing with React Router
- Simple frontend CRUD UI

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React Router
- LocalStorage API

(No heavy styling frameworks — focus is on logic.)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Components are intentionally kept simple
- Some patterns repeat — this is deliberate for muscle memory
- Code quality improves as the repo progresses, reflecting learning in real time

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

This repository represents **consistent effort over short time windows**, proving that meaningful progress can be made even with limited daily time — as long as practice is structured and intentional.

---

## 📂 Status

Ongoing practice repository.  
Will continue to evolve as I move into backend and full-stack development.
